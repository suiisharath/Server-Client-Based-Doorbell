# Server-Client Based Doorbell
**OBJECTIVE**

The project -"Network-Based Door Locking System" aims to design and implement a secure and efficient door-locking system that operates through a SCADA network. The system aims to enhance physical access control security by providing reliable and convenient door access management using network-based technology.

**ABSTRACT**

The project aims to develop a smart door access control system that leverages image processing, database querying, and distance sensing technology. Users can send a picture to a server, which performs analysis in real-time to verify the identity and grant access if authorized. Additionally, an ultrasonic sensor detects the distance between the user and the door. When the distance is less than 10 cm, the system activates a camera to capture an image for further verification. The server compares the captured image with the database and, upon successful authentication, opens the door. This integrated solution provides efficient and secure access control by utilizing real-time image analysis and distance-sensing capabilities.
